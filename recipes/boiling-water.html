    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>I have been wondering what all the fuss was about (you hear about it 
        on all the cooking shows these days), but we tried this and the boiled 
        water was FANTASTIC! A++! Tip: for a nice treat on a summer day, try it 
        refrigerated. Pour over a glass full of ice... the kids love it!</p>
